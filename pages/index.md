# Welcome to Lifesavingsports

lisasp.org stands for **Li**fe**sa**ving**sp**ort and Software Development.

## The current situation

The software landscape for lifesavingsports is rather scattered and locally focussed with isles of information and non interchangable data. This makes it hard for athletes and coaches to gather information about past and current events. Also officials have a hard time to gather the information they need.

Typical problems:

- Find official results from a validated source to use as registration times for upcoming events.
- New registration processes for every event.
- Different experiences and requirements for every events.

I am sure everyone of you can add various bullet points to this list.

## Purpose

We aim on developing software focussed to reduce the friction included with current lifesavingsport events and surrounding activities. Therefore we want to support developers working on projets with the same goals.
