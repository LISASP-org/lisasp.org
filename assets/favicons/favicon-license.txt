If you have any question regarding any content or believe that it infringes any right, that it does not comply with these Terms, or that is inappropriate, you can do so by contacting the Company as indicated in these Terms or following the instructions provided on the Website for a copyright complaint.
4.1. Sponsored Content

Regarding Sponsored Content, the Website’s role is limited to completing the search requested by the User and providing such content as a search result with a link to the relevant website together with specific related information. In some cases, in order to provide the User a better user experience and facilitate returning to the Services, the link can be presented within a frame corresponding to the Website, which can be removed by the User at any time.

The Company is not the provider of the Sponsored Content and does not present itself as owner of such contents. Furthermore, displaying the search result and the link does not imply any relationship between the Company and the third party responsible for the Sponsored Content.

The Company does not select, examine, control, guarantee, approve, sponsor or identify itself in any form with the Sponsored Content resulting of the searches made by the Users. The Sponsored Content is the sole responsibility of the third parties that make them available to the public over the Internet.

The User will be able to access the corresponding third-party websites and download the Sponsored Content under the terms and conditions established by such third parties. The Company shall not be a party or be involved in any way in the relationship between the User and the corresponding third party. The User undertakes to read and comply with the terms and conditions established by such third parties for the download and use of the Sponsored Content.

The Company is not a party and does not take part in the relationship between the User and the third party that offers the Sponsored Content, and it is not directly or indirectly responsible for the performance, omissions, errors, negligence or breaches of the Users or such third parties. Any claim from the Users regarding the Sponsored Content must be addressed to the relevant third parties through the linked website.

4.3. Collaborators Content

Collaborators Contents are offered in the terms stated at the relevant time in the Website (including, without limitation, daily download limits), and its use is allowed in the terms set out or referred to in these Terms, as applicable.

When offering Collaborators Content, the Company acts as a mere intermediary between the User that downloads such content and the collaborator, providing the User with the access and subscription to the Collaborators Content.

The Company makes reasonable efforts in guaranteeing the lawfulness of the Collaborators Content. However, the Company cannot monitor or control all Collaborators Content. Therefore, the User acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall not be responsible for evaluating the originality, the non-infringement of third-party rights or the lawfulness of Collaborator Content and that the Company does not guarantee nor is liable in respect of any such contents, except for those cases expressly provided in the applicable regulations.
5. Storage and Offer of Collaborator Content

The Company limits itself to solely hosting the Collaborator Content and, therefore, it has no obligation to edit, select, check, or control the Collaborator Content nor does it guarantee, approve or necessarily agree with the Collaborator Content. If you wish to make an enquiry related to the Collaborator Content or if you believe that the Collaborator Content violates any rights or does not meet these Terms, or is inappropriate, you can contact the Company as indicated below.

The Collaborator is responsible for the Collaborator Content provided to the Company for storage, publishing and offering to Users through the Website.
6. Liability

The User acknowledges and agrees that he/she/it uses the Website and its Services at the User’s own risk and under the User’s responsibility and, therefore, the Company does not accept any responsibility for misuse or use in breach of these Terms.

The User will be responsible for any damages to the Company resulting from the User’s use of the Website and the Services in breach of the Terms and accepts to indemnify the Company and its directors, employees, agents and representatives from any liability in which they may incur as a result of the User’s breach of these Terms.

The Company does not warrant the availability or continuity of the Website or the Services, neither its reliability, quality, completeness, accuracy or whether they are fit for a specific purpose or activity.

As way of example and without limitation, the Company shall not be liable for any damages that may result from:

    Interruptions, viruses, technical problems, interferences, omissions, unavailability, power cuts, failure of the telecommunication networks or the User’s equipment which are not the Company’s responsibility.
    Delays or unavailability of the Website and the Services due to deficiencies or traffic overload on the Internet, in the communication network or the electricity grid.
    Third-party actions.
    Unavailability of the Website and the Services due to maintenance or software updates.
    Any other event beyond the Company’s direct control.

Save for the company’s wilful misconduct, and those cases in which due to the specific circumstances of the user involved or the nature of the matter, applicable law provides that liability cannot be limited by agreement, use of the website and the services is at sole risk of the user and the company shall not be liable for any damage of any kind caused to the user as a result of using the website and/or the services.

In accordance with Section 4 above regarding Sponsored Content, the Company acts exclusively as a provider of a search service as requested by the User, without assuming any responsibility for search results.

The insertion of links in the Services does not imply any relationship, recommendation or supervision by the Company of the linked website and, accordingly, the Company does not accept any liability in relation to the content of any linked website except in the specific circumstances provided by the applicable law.

In accordance with Section 4 above regarding the Collaborator Contents, the Company acts exclusively as the provider of the intermediation service between the offer of Collaborator Content and the Users interested in downloading them, without any liability in relation to such contents, except for those cases expressly stated by the applicable law.

The Company will make reasonable commercial efforts in order to ensure the accuracy of keywords and descriptions, as well as the identification of content as exclusively for editorial use or any equivalent expression. However, the company neither warrants nor makes any representation regarding any keyword, title or description; or the identification or lack of identification of any visual content as exclusively for editorial use. For this reason and notwithstanding any other liability limitation that may be applicable in accordance with these Terms, the Company shall neither indemnify nor assume any liability in connection with any claim resulting from inaccurate keywords, titles or descriptions, or from the use of the visual content identified as exclusively for editorial use.
7. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights over the Website, the Services, and/or the Flaticon Content, its design, and source code, and all content included in any of them (including without limitation text, images, animations, databases, graphics, logos, trademarks, icons, buttons, pictures, videos, sound recordings, etc.) belong or are licensed to the Company.

Except as expressly authorized under these Terms, the reproduction or distribution, as well as transformation, producing any derivative works of any kind, public communication, making available, extraction, reuse or any other use of the Website, the Services, the Flaticon Content or any of its parts, is strictly forbidden.

The User must obtain authorizations that are, in each case, required to use any Sponsored Content.

If the third-party holder of a Sponsored Content does not want to be included in the Company’s search results, the third party can contact the Company as indicated in these Terms. Regarding a specific Sponsored Content appearing as a search result, you can use the copyright complaint that appears next to the result.

    Does not use the content in the Flaticon Content (totally or partially) in any trademark, logo or part of the same, which may be used by any other means to guarantee or to imply a guaranty of any product and/or service, unless the content in the Flaticon Content used in such cases is modified in such a way as to be a new and different content not confusingly similar with the original content in the Flaticon Content or implies a use of the content in the Flaticon Content as a template or test, and not as a final item or material;

    Does not make any use of the content in the Flaticon Content to slander, libel or to vilify a person, race, sex, culture, religion, country, region, town, village or any other place.

When any content of the Flaticon Content is marked or identified as for editorial use, or when within the same there are logos, recognizable products, public buildings, public events or images taken in places where recognizable persons appear on the background, the User shall only be entitled to use it for such editorial use. In such cases, the User undertakes not to use that content in any manner that entails advertising, marketing or commercialization of any product or service. The User shall be directly liable and the Company shall not assume any liability as a result of the use for commercial purposes by the User of any content belonging to the Flaticon Content, which according to this paragraph should be for editorial use only.

The authorization to use the content in the Flaticon Content shall be free provided that any use of the content in the Flaticon Content by the User is credited to the Company/Website as stated by the Company from time to time. In order to benefit from the Service or to use the content in the Flaticon Content without acknowledging the Company/Website, the User must purchase a subscription (hereinafter, the "Subscription") in the Website and download the content in the Flaticon Content during the term of any such Subscription. Conditions in Section 9 shall apply to the purchase of the Subscription.

It is forbidden for a User to authorize any third parties to use the Flaticon Content (or any modification of any content in the Flaticon Content). As an exception to the prohibition, the User may allow third parties to use the content in the Flaticon Content, when each and every of the following conditions are met:

    The third party has professionally instructed the User to produce goods or provide services to it/him/her and the User uses a limited number of items within the content in the Flaticon Content to produce such goods or provide such services to the instructing third party;
    The authorization granted by the User to the third party is in writing and complies with every restriction of the User’s authorization to use the relevant content in the Flaticon Content and includes, without limitation, a restriction for the third party to distribute, resell or license the relevant content in the Flaticon Content (i.e. the third party is the final user of the relevant content in the Flaticon Content);
    None of the contents in the Flaticon Content which are subject to the authorization are used as the main element (because of size, relevance or any other cause; in case of doubt about whether the content is the main element, it shall be deemed as the main element) in printed or electronic items (e.g. t-shirts, cups, postcards, birthday or greeting cards, invitations, calendars, web models or electronic devices, apps, videogames, advertising spots, audiovisual animations) aimed to be resold by the third party;
    The production of goods or provision of services by the User to the third party is not done by automatic means, it is tailor made for the third party (and therefore its use is not authorized by the User to any other third party) and requires a specific substantial human intervention from the User in relation to each third party, and;
    The User -and not the third party- chooses the specific items within the content of the Flaticon Content to be used in the production of goods or provision of services for the third party.

When all of the above conditions are met, the User shall be entitled to authorize a third party to use the relevant content in the Flaticon Content. This exception refers only to the prohibition for the User to authorize third parties to use the content in the Flaticon Content without affecting or limiting in any way the remaining conditions of the User’s right to use the Flaticon Content. Whether the above conditions regarding the exception to the prohibition for Users to authorize third parties to use the content in the Flaticon Content are met shall be interpreted restrictively so that, in case of doubt, it shall be deemed that the conditions are not met.

The User does not acquire any right as a result of the use of the content in the Flaticon Content. In particular, the User is not authorized to distribute, resell or rent any content in the Flaticon Content (or any modification of any content in the Flaticon Content).

Once the User purchases the Subscription, the screen shall confirm the purchase. In addition, within the shortest time reasonably possible and not after twenty-four (24) hours since the acceptance of the order, an email shall be sent to the User with the receipt of the purchase.

However, the Company will comply with its obligations regarding the keeping of records in relation to certain transactions for the relevant period as provided by applicable law or refund the Users of Subscriptions in force at that time with the proportional part of the price not accrued before the termination.
11. General and Contact Information
